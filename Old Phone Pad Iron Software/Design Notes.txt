rules for project creation:
-Each digit has a few letters. If the same digit is pressed several times, the letter selected will change under the same digit.
Example: 22 for B. This means that the sequence will determine the letter.

-There will be special characters for different functionalities:
* deletes the last character
# indicates the end of the message
' ' is a space between words. 

Data Type:
-it needs to be capable of storing a pair of Key/ value, the number will be the key, and de letter will be the value
-the data type needed to be a generic collection to avoid having to write dynamic behavior, so array wouldnÂ´t be suitable. 
-SortedList maintains an order in the keys and it's less faster than a Dictionary, we don't need keys to be ordered, only 
be associated to a value.
-Dictionary woould be the right one to use


Structures:
There are several ways to generate the function we need.

-We will need a variable for the final message (string) and another one that stores the letter according to the numerical 
sequence, which will be added at the last position in the message written.
-a structure of if/else if can be used but it is not the most efficient in this case because each time the method is called,
each statement will be evaluated according to the condition, and in this case they are independent options, not conditions
to be met. This makes the code less efficient and slower.
-each number equals to a different letter. so we can use a switch directly but that means that we also going to have to code
the cases that the number are repeated. Example if I want a "B" y need to have a case for 22, if I want a "C", I need a 
specific case for 222. That will force me to write a code for each letter in the alphabet (that's a lot of codeing)
-this could be avoided if I use a algorithm that discriminates the expected letter when the number is made up of repeated 
digits. example 22, 777, 33.
